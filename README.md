# Color Splash Game

A simple browser game using HTML5 canvas. Colorful blobs bounce around the screen and you must click them to splash them. Each click makes the blob burst in a short splatter animation and increases your score. You have 60 seconds to get as many points as possible.


## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Click on the moving blobs to score points.
3. A quick pop sound plays and the blob splashes when hit (if supported by your browser).
4. When the timer reaches zero, your final score will be displayed.
5. Press **Restart** to play again.

Enjoy splashing!
